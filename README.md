A chrome extension designed to allow you to automatically utilise the university proxy for research databases. All you need to do is click "Add to Proxy" once for the domain, then all future visits will automatically use the proxy.

### How to use
- ~~Install LibraryProxy from the Chrome Web Store~~[Awaiting approval] (or clone this repo and load into chrome as unpacked extension)
- Simply click on the LibraryProxy icon, and click "Add to Proxy" from the domain you want. For example if you wish to add https://dl.acm.org to the proxy, simply visit any page on that domain and click on Library Proxy, then "Add to Proxy"
- If you wish to remove a domain from the proxy, simply visit the domain and then click on Library proxy, then click "Remove from Proxy"
